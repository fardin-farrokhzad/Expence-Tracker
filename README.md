# Expense Tracker

Expense Tracker is a web-based financial management application built with **React.js** and **Vite**. It provides users with an intuitive interface for tracking personal expenses and incomes, visualizing their financial activity, and maintaining full control over cash flow through a responsive and minimal design.

The application enables users to create, edit, and delete transactions, flag them as expenses or incomes, and view all data in a structured transaction table. Data persistence is handled through the browser’s **localStorage**, ensuring that user information remains available across sessions without requiring external databases or backend integration.

The focus of this project is on clean architecture, maintainable code, and practical implementation of React fundamentals. It applies modern development practices such as component-driven design, controlled state management with React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), conditional rendering, and modular CSS styling. No external state management or CSS frameworks are used to preserve full control over the application’s internal logic and presentation.
